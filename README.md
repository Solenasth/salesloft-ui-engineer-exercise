## Project Overview

## A note on safari < 14.1

during this proyect I used the "gap" property. however earlier safari versions do not support it.
Unfortunately, Safari kinda supports gap in grid, so the standard practice of checking for `@supports` also does not work.

This is one of those weird cases where there is no easy CSS-only solution.
for this reason please use version 14.1+ when reviewing in safari.
